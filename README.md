These codes were used for the thesis on the effect of references on crowdfunding success
The objective of this research is to examine the impact of references on the success of crowdfunding projects. To achieve this goal, we employed scraping tools to collect data from the popular crowdfunding website, Indiegogo. The collected data encompasses both quantitative and qualitative variables, including the number of backers, funding goals, funding mechanisms, project categories, and textual content. Subsequently, we utilized various analytical methods and tools, such as descriptive analysis, regression analysis, and ANOVA to analyze the data and derive insights that will address our hypotheses and subquestions.
